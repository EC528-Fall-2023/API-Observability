## Project Description Template

The purpose of this Project Description is to present the ideas proposed and decisions made during the preliminary envisioning and inception phase of the project. The goal is to analyze an initial concept proposal at a strategic level of detail and attain/compose an agreement between the project team members and the project customer (mentors and instructors) on the desired solution and overall project direction.

This template proposal contains a number of sections, which you can edit/modify/add/delete/organize as you like.  Some key sections weâ€™d like to have in the proposal are:

- Vision: An executive summary of the vision, goals, users, and general scope of the intended project.

- Solution Concept: the approach the project team will take to meet the business needs. This section also provides an overview of the architectural and technical designs made for implementing the project.

- Scope: the boundary of the solution defined by itemizing the intended features and functions in detail, determining what is out of scope, a release strategy and possibly the criteria by which the solution will be accepted by users and operations.

Project Proposal can be used during the follow-up analysis and design meetings to give context to efforts of more detailed technical specifications and plans. It provides a clear direction for the project team; outlines project goals, priorities, and constraints; and sets expectations.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

The vision section describes the final desired state of the project once the project is complete. It also specifies the key goals of the project. This section provides a context for decision-making. A shared vision among all team members can help ensuring that the solution meets the intended goals. A solid vision clarifies perspective and facilitates decision-making.

The vision statement should be specific enough that you can look at a proposed solution and say either "yes, this meets the vision and goals", or "no, it does not".

Our vision for this project is to construct an efficient system for effectively managing various APIs. We aspire to create a solution that encompasses innovation, speed, and informed decision-making by providing an inventory and measurement framework for RESTful and gRPC APIs.

Our Goals:

- **API Management**: We aim to simplify the complexity of API management by offering a platform that allows users to effortlessly track and monitor their API services.
- **Enhanced Speed**: One of our goals is to accelerate the development of services, enabling businesses to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital world. This will be achieved through the use of cloud-native application development practices.
- **Support for REST and gRPC**: Our project will support RESTful and gRPC API development practices, ensuring compatibility with various integration methods and allowing organizations to choose the solution that best fits their needs.

With these goals in mind, our project will empower different organizations to easily align their business objectives with API strategies, ultimately increasing their performance and competitiveness.

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

This product would be designed for various stakeholders involved in development and upkeep of API development and management. The product how ever will target: 

 - **API Developers**: Individuals responsible for designing, building, and maintaining REST and gRPC APIs so that they can efficiently manage and document their system.
 - **API Consumers**: Developers or applications that rely on their organization's APIs who want easy-access to comprehensive API documentation and authentication methods.
 - **DevOps Teams**: Operation teams that aim to deploy and maintain APIs in the cloud for high availability and performance tracking
 - **Product Managers**: Individuals who monitor the metrics, and user-behaviors of their system to make informed data-driven decisions. 


## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:

The Scope places a boundary around the solution by detailing the range of features and functions of the project. This section helps to clarify the solution scope and can explicitly state what will not be delivered as well.

It should be specific enough that you can determine that e.g. feature A is in-scope, while feature B is out-of-scope.

## 4. Solution Concept

This section provides a high-level outline of the solution.

Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:

This section provides a high-level architecture or a conceptual diagram showing the scope of the solution. If wireframes or visuals have already been done, this section could also be used to show how the intended solution will look. This section also provides a walkthrough explanation of the architectural structure.

 

Design Implications and Discussion:

This section discusses the implications and reasons of the design decisions made during the global architecture design.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

This section discusses the minimum acceptance criteria at the end of the project and stretch goals.

## 6.  Release Planning:

Release planning section describes how the project will deliver incremental sets of features and functions in a series of releases to completion. Identification of user stories associated with iterations that will ease/guide sprint planning sessions is encouraged. Higher level details for the first iteration is expected.

## General comments

Remember that you can always add features at the end of the semester, but you can't go back in time and gain back time you spent on features that you couldn't complete.

## Project Description Template

The purpose of this Project Description is to present the ideas proposed and decisions made during the preliminary envisioning and inception phase of the project. The goal is to analyze an initial concept proposal at a strategic level of detail and attain/compose an agreement between the project team members and the project customer (mentors and instructors) on the desired solution and overall project direction.

This template proposal contains a number of sections, which you can edit/modify/add/delete/organize as you like.  Some key sections weâ€™d like to have in the proposal are:

- Vision: An executive summary of the vision, goals, users, and general scope of the intended project.

- Solution Concept: the approach the project team will take to meet the business needs. This section also provides an overview of the architectural and technical designs made for implementing the project.

- Scope: the boundary of the solution defined by itemizing the intended features and functions in detail, determining what is out of scope, a release strategy and possibly the criteria by which the solution will be accepted by users and operations.

Project Proposal can be used during the follow-up analysis and design meetings to give context to efforts of more detailed technical specifications and plans. It provides a clear direction for the project team; outlines project goals, priorities, and constraints; and sets expectations.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

Our vision is to empower organizations with the tools and capabilities needed to ensure the performance, security, and reliability of their APIs in real-time. We aim to create a seamless and user-friendly observability solution that provides immediate insights into API behavior, enabling faster decision-making, proactive issue resolution, and enhanced user experiences.

### 1. Real-Time API Monitoring

- **Goal:** Enable real-time monitoring of API traffic, performance, and behavior.
- **Objective:** Ensure that you can react to issues and opportunities as they happen, minimizing downtime and maximizing user satisfaction.

### 2. Comprehensive Data Collection

- **Goal:** Collect and store comprehensive data about API interactions and system health.
- **Objective:** Provide rich insights into API usage, errors, latency, and other critical metrics for better decision-making.

### 3. Scalability and Performance

- **Goal:** Create a scalable and high-performance observability system.
- **Objective:** Ensure that the system can handle increasing data volumes and maintain responsiveness under heavy loads.

### 4. Security and Compliance

- **Goal:** Implement robust security measures and compliance with data privacy regulations.
- **Objective:** Protect sensitive data, user privacy, and adhere to industry-specific compliance standards.

### 5. User-Friendly Visualization

- **Goal:** Provide intuitive and customizable dashboards for data visualization.
- **Objective:** Enable users to easily access and interpret API observability data, with the ability to create personalized views.

### 6. Anomaly Detection and Insights

- **Goal:** Develop machine learning-based anomaly detection and insights generation.
- **Objective:** Automatically identify unusual patterns and provide actionable insights to address issues and opportunities.

### 7. Integration and Extensibility

- **Goal:** Facilitate easy integration with external tools and services.
- **Objective:** Allow you to leverage the observability data in your existing workflows, such as incident management and analytics.

### 8. Documentation and Support

- **Goal:** Provide comprehensive documentation and support resources.
- **Objective:** Empower users to effectively implement and maximize the benefits of the observability system.


## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

This product would be designed for various stakeholders involved in development and upkeep of API development and management. The product how ever will target: 

 - **API Developers**: Individuals responsible for designing, building, and maintaining REST and gRPC APIs so that they can efficiently manage and document their system.
 - **API Consumers**: Developers or applications that rely on their organization's APIs who want easy-access to comprehensive API documentation and authentication methods.
 - **DevOps Teams**: Operation teams that aim to deploy and maintain APIs in the cloud for high availability and performance tracking
 - **Product Managers**: Individuals who monitor the metrics, and user-behaviors of their system to make informed data-driven decisions. 


## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:

The Scope places a boundary around the solution by detailing the range of features and functions of the project. This section helps to clarify the solution scope and can explicitly state what will not be delivered as well.

It should be specific enough that you can determine that e.g. feature A is in-scope, while feature B is out-of-scope.

## 4. Solution Concept

The architecture of our solution starts with a data collection layer, which consists of an API gateway and instrumentation. The API gateway will capture data about each incoming request, such as request headers, payload, and metadata, while the instrumentation will collect data on request handling, response times, errors, and other relevant metrics. This information will then be passed into a data ingestion and processing layer, which includes a message queue that will be responsible for publishing data events into the queue. From here, the information will be either stream-processed or batch-processed. The stream processing will be done to handle the real-time analytics and log/event processing. The batch processing will be done to handle historical data that can be used for analytics, machine learning, or generating reports. The next layer of our solution is data storage. The data storage layer contains a time-series database which is responsible for storing time-series data for metrics such as request/response times, error rates, and traffic volume. Additionally, there will be log/trace storage which will provide detailed information regarding the log and trace data that is collected. The next layer is data visualization and dashboarding. This will be used to visualize and monitor all of the information that is being collected and gives the ability to create alert systems for different metrics.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

This section discusses the minimum acceptance criteria at the end of the project and stretch goals.

## 6.  Release Planning:

### Sprint 23A (Sept 22 to Sept 29)
- Meet with mentor to learn demands and requirements for the project
- Familiarize ourselves with gRPC and Observability
- Investigate and plan cloud development considerations, including cloud service selection
- Investigate metric measurement applications, and evaluate intergration options with metrics and visualization tools.

## General comments

Remember that you can always add features at the end of the semester, but you can't go back in time and gain back time you spent on features that you couldn't complete.
